### Nobody gets married thinking: "Maybe I'll try this out for a while and see how it goes." 

They all go into it saying "If I get married it's going to be for forever."

And yet, people get divorced all the time. Lots of them. That alone should make people wonder if all those confident assertions are really worth the breath they were uttered with. And, at some point, you start to wonder if anybody knows about what makes a marriage work. If marriage is supposed to be so central to society why not study it? And if a society or government wants people to stay married, why not fund some research? That would be research that could be immediately useful than a lot of things.

Well, it turns this has been done and for years. As a result, amongst sociologists and marriage therapists what makes a marriage work isn't really all that much of a secret. A lot of them point the work of Drs. John and Julie Gottman.

### What does this have to do with Machine Learning?

There are two parts. One is taking statements of people and comparing them to people who are divorced. The otherOne is operationalizing the results. That is know if things are going smoothly or if you think things are ok but in reality, you're cruising towards a divorce.
